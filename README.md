# CS-370

#Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
This project provided a challenge of developing an intelligent agent using a Deep Network. The Agent has the responsibility of solving a treasure hunting maze. Starter code was provided that had the base dependencies and data proccessing methods. The primary method that I had to develop was for the reinforcement learning and neural network. 
  
#Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
#What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer Scientist primarily dedicate their efforts to solving problems with unique, coputer-based solutions. This often involves implementation of software tools that users can interact with in order to improve every day life or greatly increase commercial and industrial efficiency. Many tools that are created by Computer Scientists use algorithms designed to quickly process data to output solutions. This matters because computers have enabled mankind to solve problems that previously took great manual labor or time. 

#How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, I approach problems with heirarchal and deductive reasoning. I break down problems into their simplest pieces, and I design a solution from the ground up. 
#What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
Ethical responsibilities for the Computer Scientist often entail ensuring the security of the code they create as well as their impact to users. They bear the responsibility of informing users and organizations of every way that the programs they develop will use data and how it will comply with State, National, and international laws.
